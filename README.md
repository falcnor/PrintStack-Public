## 🚀 Enhanced Usage

### Getting Started with Enhanced Features

1. **Add Enhanced Filaments**: Navigate to the Filament Library and add detailed filament
   information including brand, material type, hex color codes, diameter, temperature ranges, and
   purchase details.

2. **Create Models with Usage Requirements**: Go to the Models Library and specify expected filament
   consumption, tolerance settings, print parameters, and organizational tags.

3. **Track Print History**: Use the Print History page to log completed prints with actual usage,
   quality ratings, and print settings. Inventory updates automatically.

4. **Analyze Usage Patterns**: Check the enhanced Statistics page to see comprehensive usage
   reports, cost analytics, and efficiency metrics.

### Enhanced Data Structure
